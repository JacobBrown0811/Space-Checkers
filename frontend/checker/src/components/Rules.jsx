        <h2>Objective:</h2>Embark on an extraterrestrial journey to capture all your opponent's cosmic pieces or strategically outmaneuver them, leaving them with no legal moves.
        <h2>Setup:</h2>The game unfolds on a celestial 8x8 checkerboard, adorned with dark and light space-themed squares. Each player starts with 12 pieces, symbolizing their interstellar presence, and places them on the dark squares of the three rows closest to their launch pad.
        <h2>Movement:</h2>Pieces traverse the cosmic expanse by moving diagonally forward one space, representing their intergalactic journey.
    A piece achieves the esteemed title of "Star Sovereign" if it reaches the last row of the opponent's cosmic quadrant, gaining the ability to move both forward and backward across the cosmic battlefield.
        <h2>Capture:</h2>Engage in cosmic conquest by capturing an opponent's piece. Leapfrog over an adversary's celestial entity when an empty space beckons beyond, securing victory in the name of your galactic empire.
    The cosmos applauds multiple captures in a single turn, allowing for a cascade of strategic moves in a continuous diagonal line.
    <h2>Star Sovereign's Capture:</h2>Ascendant Star Sovereigns, now capable of traversing the cosmos with unparalleled versatility, can capture opponents by jumping over their celestial counterparts diagonally forward or backward.
    <h2>End of the Celestial Clash:</h2>The intergalactic conflict concludes when one player seizes control of the entire cosmic domain, effectively capturing all of their opponent's astral entities or confining them to a celestial blockade.
    Alternatively, a draw in the cosmic symphony occurs if the cosmic constellations align, repeating the same celestial position three times, or if both entities are trapped in a cosmic stalemate with no legal moves.
